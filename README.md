# Competitive-Programming
This projects includes some of my solutions to CP's contests.

You can expect CodeForces, CodeChef, COCI problems' solutions and more.

Note that most of my submissions feature a heavy template and CP-style programming.
The actual code will often be inside `void solve(){...}`.
